# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-AI-and-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a real-time hand gesture recognition system using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The system enables users to interact with a computer or digital device using hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a keyboard or mouse.
