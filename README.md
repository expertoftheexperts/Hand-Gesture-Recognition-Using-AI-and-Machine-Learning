# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-AI-and-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on developing a real-time hand gesture recognition system using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The system enables users to interact with a computer or digital device using hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a keyboard or mouse.
This approach not only enhances the naturalness of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) but also provides a more accessible solution for individuals with physical disabilities.
To achieve this, the system uses a webcam to capture real-time video, from which hand landmarks are extracted using MediaPipe, a powerful framework by Google. These 21 key points of the hand are then passed through pre-trained machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification. The entire system is developed using the Python programming language, leveraging popular libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and scikit-learn.
The project supports a wide range of gestures including common ones like Open Palm, Fist, Thumbs Up, and culturally significant gestures such as Namaste and Salaam, expanding its usability in diverse social contexts. The model is trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving over 95% accuracy in controlled conditions.
In addition to the technical implementation, this project emphasizes real-world deployment, ensuring that the system can run efficiently on standard computing devices with the potential for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano. Future enhancements include adding multimodal interactions (gesture + voice), optimizing the system for low-light conditions, and expanding the gesture set for broader functionality.
Overall, the project not only demonstrates the application of AI and ML in solving real-world HCI problems but also contributes to the growing field of gesture-based interfaces in the modern digital ecosystem.
